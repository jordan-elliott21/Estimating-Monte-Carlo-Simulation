# Estimating-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This tool is made to help estimator's calculate and charge for risk/escalation. This tool/analysis method takes a random number for each cost item in an estimate using a PERT Distribution, based on predetermined "minimum," "most likely," and "maximum" values. It then repeats this 10,000 times for each item. It then uses the random numbers to calculate some statistics that help estimators determine the amount extra to charge to account for the risk that things may be more expensive than originally estimated.

The objective of this project was to remove the need for my company to continue purchasing expensive SaaS services that provided Monte Carlo Risk Analysis and to build it in-house. I also wanted to speed up the time it used to take to run the simulations via the SaaS. It could take anywhere from 5-10 minutes to run the old simulation, this version only runs for around 10 seconds. The intention of this Python project was not just to create a oneoff analysis for this project, but to provide an estimating tool that estimators can reuse on their own. I was able to use this code in conjunction with "Python in Excel," to provide a smooth user experience for estimators.
